ࡡࡡ, placably.  "I'm old-fashioned myself;
and the things keep together."

     "And vanish together, as you see," she retorted.  "Well, if you are
not going to bother about the burglar, I shouldn't bother about the lunch.
It's Sunday, and we can't send for vinegar and all that in the town;
and you Indian gentlemen can't enjoy what you call a dinner without
a lot of hot things.  I wish to goodness now you hadn't asked
Cousin Oliver to take me to the musical service.  It isn't over
till half-past twelve, and the Colonel has to leave by then.
I don't believe you men can manage alone."

     "Oh yes, we can, my dear," said the Major, looking at her
very amiably.  "Marco has all the sauces, and we've often
done ourselves well in very rough places, as you might know by now.
And it's time you had a treat, Audrey; you mustn't be a housekeeper
every hour of the day; and I know you want to hear the music."

     "I want to go to church," she said, with rather severe eyes.

     She was one of those handsome women who will always be handsome,
because the beauty is not in an air or a tint, but in the very structure
of the head and features.  But though she was not yet middle-aged
and her auburn hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour,
there was a look in her mouth and around her eyes which suggested that
some sorrows wasted her, as winds waste at last the edges of a Greek temple.
For indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speaking
so decisively was rather comic than tragic.  Father Brown gathered,
from the course of the conversation, that Cray, the other gourmet,
had to leave before the usual lunch-time; but that Putnam, his host,
not to be done out of a final feast with an old crony, had arranged
for a special dejeuner to be set out and consumed in the course of
the morning, while Audrey and other graver persons were at morning service.
She was going there under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers,
Dr Oliver Oman, who, though a scientific man of a somewhat bitter type,
was enthusiastic for music, and would go even to church to get it.
There was nothing in all this that could conceivably concern
the tragedy in Miss Watson's face; and by a half conscious instinct,
Father Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing about
in the grass.

     When he strolled across to him, the black, unbrushed head was
lifted abruptly, as if in some surprise at his continued presence.
And indeed, Father Brown, for reasons best known to himself,
had lingered much longer than politeness required; or even,
in the ordinary sense, permitted.

     "Well!" cried Cray, with wild eyes.  "I suppose you think I'm mad,
like the rest?"

     "I have considered the thesis," answered the little man, composedly.
"And I incline to think you are not."

     "What do you mean?" snapped Cray quite savagely.

     "Real madmen," explained Father Brown, "always encourage their
own morbidity.  They never strive against it.  But you are trying
to find traces of the burglar; even when there aren't any.
You are struggling against it.  You want what no madman ever wants."

     "And what is that?"

     "You want to be proved wrong," said Brown.

     During the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet
and was regarding the cleric with agitated eyes.  "By hell,
but that is a true word!" he cried.  "They are all at me here
that the fellow was only after the silver--as if I shouldn't be
only too pleased to think so!  She's been at me," and he tossed his tousled
black head towards Audrey, but the other had no need of the direction,
"she's been at me today about how cruel I was to shoot a poor harmless
house-breaker, and how I have the devil in me against poor harmless natives.
But I was a good-natured man once--as good-natured as Putnam."

     After a pause he said:  "Look here, I've never seen you before;
but you shall judge of the whole story.  Old Putnam and I were friends
in the same mess; but, owing to some accidents on the Afghan border,
I got my command much sooner than most men; only we were both
invalided home for a bit.  I was engaged to Audrey out there;
and we all travelled back together.  But on the journey back
things happened.  Curious things.  The result of them was
that Putnam wants it broken off, and even Audrey keeps it hanging on--
and I know what they mean.  I know what they think I am.  So do you.

     "Well, these are the facts.  The last day we were in
an Indian city I asked Putnam if I could get some Trichinopoli cigars,
he directed me to a little place opposite his lodgings.
I have since found he was quite right; but `opposite' is a dangerous word
when one decent house stands opposite five or six squalid ones;
and I must have mistaken the door.  It opened with difficulty,
and then only on darkness; but as I turned back, the door behind me
sank back and settled into its place with a noise as of innumerable bolts.
There was nothing to do but to walk forward; which I did through
passage after passage, pitch-dark.  Then I came to a flight of steps,
and then to a blind door, secured by a latch of elaborate Eastern ironwork,
which I could only trace by touch, but which I loosened at last.
I came out again upon gloom, which was half turned into
a greenish twilight by a multitude of small but steady lamps below.
They showed merely the feet or fringes of some huge and empty architecture.
Just in front of me was something that looked like a mountain.
I confess I nearly fell on the great stone platform on which I had emerged,
to realize that it was an idol.  And worst of all, an idol with
its back to me.

     "It was hardly half human, I guessed; to judge by the small squat head,
and still more by a thing like a tail or extra limb turned up behind
and pointing, like a loathsome large finger, at some symbol graven
in the centre of the vast stone back.  I had begun, in the dim light,
to guess at the hieroglyphic, not without horror, when a more horrible
thing happened.  A door opened silently in the temple wall
behind me and a man came out, with a brown face and a black coat.
He had a carved smile on his face, of copper flesh and ivory teeth;
but I think the most hateful thing about him was that he was
in European dress.  I was prepared, I think, for shrouded priests
or naked fakirs.  But this seemed to say that the devilry was
over all the earth.  As indeed I found it to be.

     "`If you had only seen the Monkey's Feet,' he said, smiling steadily,
and without other preface, `we should have been very gentle--
you would only be tortured and die.  If you had seen the Monkey's Face,
still we should be very moderate, very tolerant--you would only
be tortured and live.  But as you have seen the Monkey's Tail,
we must pronounce the worst sentence. which is--Go Free.'

     "When he said the words I heard the elaborate iron latch with
which I had struggled, automatically unlock itself:  and then,
far down the dark passages I had passed, I heard the heavy street-door
shifting its own bolts backwards.

     "`It is vain to ask for mercy; you must go free,' said
the smiling man.  `Henceforth a hair shall slay you like a sword,
and a breath shall bite you like an adder; weapons shall come
against you out of nowhere; and you shall die many times.'
And with that he was swallowed once more in the wall behind;
and I went out into the street."

     Cray paused; and Father Brown unaffectedly sat down on the lawn
and began to pick daisies.

     Then the soldier continued:  "Putnam, of course, with his
jolly common sense, pooh-poohed all my fears; and from that time
dates his doubt of my mental balance.  Well, I'll simply tell you,
in the fewest words, the three things that have happened since;
and you shall judge which of us is right.

     "The first happened in an Indian village on the edge of the jungle,
but hundreds of miles from the temple, or town, or type of tribes
and customs where the curse had been put on me.  I woke in black midnight,
and lay thinking of nothing in particular, when I felt a faint
tickling thing, like a thread or a hair, trailed across my throat.
I shrank back out of its way, and could not help thinking of the words
in the temple.  But when I got up and sought lights and a mirror,
the line across my neck was a line of blood.

     "The second happened in a lodging in Port Said, later,
on our journey home together.  It was a jumble of tavern
and curiosity-shop; and though there was nothing there remotely suggesting
the cult of the Monkey, it is, of course, possible that some of its
images or talismans were in such a place.  Its curse was there, anyhow.
I woke again in the dark with a sensation that could not be put
in colder or more literal words than that a breath bit like an adder.
Existence was an agony of extinction; I dashed my head against walls
until I dashed it against a window; and fell rather than jumped
into the garden below.  Putnam, poor fellow, who had called the other thing
a chance scratch, was bound to take seriously the fact of finding me
half insensible on the grass at dawn.  But I fear it was my mental state
he took seriously; and not my story.

     "The third happened in Malta.  We were in a fortress there;
and as it happened our bedrooms overlooked the open sea, which almost
came up to our window-sills, save for a flat white outer wall
as bare as the sea.  I woke up again; but it was not dark.
There was a full moon, as I walked to the window; I could have seen a bird
on the bare battlement, or a sail on the horizon.  What I did see
was a sort of stick or branch circling, self-supported, in the empty sky.
It flew straight in at my window and smashed the lamp beside the pillow
I had just quitted.  It was one of those queer-shaped war-clubs
some Eastern tribes use.  But it had come from no human hand."

     Father Brown threw away a daisy-chain he was making,
and rose with a wistful look.  "Has Major Putnam," he asked,
"got any Eastern curios, idols, weapons and so on, from which
one might get a hint?"

     "Plenty of those, though not much use, I fear," replied Cray;
"but by all means come into his study."

     As they entered they passed Miss Watson buttoning her gloves for church,
and heard the voice of Putnam downstairs still giving a lecture on cookery
to the cook.  In the Major's study and den of curios they came suddenly
on a third party, silk-hatted and dressed for the street, who was
poring over an open book on the smoking-table--a book which he dropped
rather guiltily, and turned.

     Cray introduced him civilly enough, as Dr Oman, but he showed
such disfavour in his very face that Brown guessed the two men,
whether Audrey knew it or not, were rivals.  Nor was the priest
wholly unsympathetic with the prejudice.  Dr Oman was a very well-dressed
gentleman indeed; well-featured, though almost dark enough for an Asiatic.
But Father Brown had to tell himself sharply that one should be in charity
even with those who wax their pointed beards, who have small gloved hands,
and who speak with perfectly modulated voices.

     Cray seemed to find something specially irritating in
the small prayer-book in Oman's dark-gloved hand.  "I didn't know
that was in your line," he said rather rudely.

     Oman laughed mildly, but without offence.  "This is more so, I know,"
he said, laying his hand on the big book he had dropped,
"a dictionary of drugs and such things.  But it's rather too large
to take to church."  Then he closed the larger book, and there seemed
again the faintest touch of hurry and embarrassment.

     "I suppose," said the priest, who seemed anxious to change the subject,
"all these spears and things are from India?"

     "From everywhere," answered the doctor.  "Putnam is an old soldier,
and has been in Mexico and Australia, and the Cannibal Islands
for all I know."

     "I hope it was not in the Cannibal Islands," said Brown,
"that he learnt the art of cookery." And he ran his eyes over
the stew-pots or other strange utensils on the wall.

     At this moment the jolly subject of their conversation
thrust his laughing, lobsterish face into the room.  "Come along, Cray,"
he cried.  "Your lunch is just coming in.  And the bells are ringing
for those who want to go to church."

     Cray slipped upstairs to change; Dr Oman and Miss Watson betook
themselves solemnly down the street, with a string of other churchgoers;
but Father Brown noticed that the doctor twice looked back
and scrutinized the house; and even came back to the corner of the street
to look at it again.

     The priest looked puzzled.  "He can't have been at the dustbin,"
he muttered.  "Not in those clothes.  Or was he there earlier today?"

     Father Brown, touching other people, was as sensitive as a barometer;
but today he seemed about as sensitive as a rhinoceros.  By no social law,
rigid or implied, could he be supposed to linger round the lunch
of the Anglo-Indian friends; but he lingered, covering his position
with torrents of amusing but quite needless conversation.
He was the more puzzling because he did not seem to want any lunch.
As one after another of the most exquisitely balanced kedgerees of curries,
accompanied with their appropriate vintages, were laid before
the other two, he only repeated that it was one of his fast-days,
and munched a piece of bread and sipped and then left untasted
a tumbler of cold water.  His talk, however, was exuberant.

     "I'll tell you what I'll do for you," he cried--, "I'll mix you
a salad!  I can't eat it, but I'll mix it like an angel!
You've got a lettuce there."

     "Unfortunately it's the only thing we have got," answered
the good-humoured Major.  "You must remember that mustard, vinegar,
oil and so on vanished with the cruet and the burglar."

     "I know," replied Brown, rather vaguely.  "That's what I've always
been afraid would happen.  That's why I always carry a cruet-stand
about with me.  I'm so fond of salads."

     And to the amazement of the two men he took a pepper-pot out of
his waistcoat pocket and put it on the table.

     "I wonder why the burglar wanted mustard, too," he went on,
taking a mustard-pot from another pocket.  "A mustard plaster,
I suppose.  And vinegar"--and producing that condiment--
"haven't I heard something about vinegar and brown paper?
As for oil, which I think I put in my left--"

     His garrulity was an instant arrested; for lifting his eyes,
he saw what no one else saw--the black figure of Dr Oman standing
on the sunlit lawn and looking steadily into the room.  Before he could
quite recover himself Cray had cloven in.

     "You're an astounding card," he said, staring.  "I shall come
and hear your sermons, if they're as amusing as your manners."
His voice changed a little, and he leaned back in his chair.

     "Oh, there are sermons in a cruet-stand, too," said Father Brown,
quite gravely.  "Have you heard of faith like a grain of mustard-seed;
or charity that anoints with oil?  And as for vinegar, can any soldiers
forget that solitary soldier, who, when the sun was darkened--"

     Colonel Cray leaned forward a little and clutched the tablecloth.

     Father Brown, who was making the salad, tipped two spoonfuls
of the mustard into the tumbler of water beside him; stood up and said
in a new, loud and sudden voice--"Drink that!"

     At the same moment the motionless doctor in the garden came running,
and bursting open a window cried:  "Am I wanted?  Has he been poisoned?"

     "Pretty near," said Brown, with the shadow of a smile; for
the emetic had very suddenly taken effect.  And Cray lay in a deck-chair,
gasping as for life, but alive.

     Major Putnam had sprung up, his purple face mottled.  "A crime!"
he cried hoarsely.  "I will go for the police!"

     The priest could hear him dragging down his palm-leaf hat from the peg
and tumbling out of the front door; he heard the garden gate slam.
But he only stood looking at Cray; and after a silence said quietly:

     "I shall not talk to you much; but I will tell you what
you want to know.  There is no curse on you.  The Temple of the Monkey
was either a coincidence or a part of the trick; the trick was
the trick of a white man.  There is only one weapon that will bring blood
with that mere feathery touch:  a razor held by a white man.
There is one way of making a common room full of invisible,
overpowering poison:  turning on the gas--the crime of a white man.
And there is only one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window,
turn in mid-air and come back to the window next to it:
the Australian boomerang.  You'll see some of them in the Major's study."

     With that he went outside and spoke for a moment to the doctor.
The moment after, Audrey Watson came rushing into the house and
fell on her knees beside Cray's chair.  He could not hear what they said
to each other; but their faces moved with amazement, not unhappiness.
The doctor and the priest walked slowly towards the garden gate.

     "I suppose the Major was in love with her, too," he said with a sigh;
and when the other nodded, observed:  "You were very generous, doctor.
You did a fine thing.  But what made you suspect?"

     "A very small thing," said Oman; "but it kept me restless in church
till I came back to see that all was well.  That book on his table
was a work on poisons; and was put down open at the place where it stated
that a certain Indian poison, though deadly and difficult to trace,
was particularly easily reversible by the use of the commonest emetics.
I suppose he read that at the last moment--"

     "And remembered that there were emetics in the cruet-stand,"
said Father Brown.  "Exactly.  He threw the cruet in the dustbin--
where I found it, along with other silver--for the sake of
a burglary blind.  But if you look at that pepper-pot I put on the table,
you'll see a small hole.  That's where Cray's bullet struck,
shaking up the pepper and making the criminal sneeze."

     There was a silence.  Then Dr Oman said grimly:  "The Major is
a long time looking for the police."

     "Or the police in looking for the Major?" said the priest.
"Well, good-bye."




XI. The Strange Crime of John Boulnois


MR CALHOUN KIDD was a very young gentleman with a very old face,
a face dried up with its own eagerness, framed in blue-black hair
and a black butterfly tie.  He was the emissary in England
of the colossal American daily called the Western Sun--
also humorously described as the "Rising Sunset".  This was in allusion
to a great journalistic declaration (attributed to Mr Kidd himself)
that "he guessed the sun would rise in the west yet, if American citizens
did a bit more hustling." Those, however, who mock American journalism
from the standpoint of somewhat mellower traditions forget
a certain paradox which partly redeems it.  For while the journalism
of the States permits a pantomimic vulgarity long past anything English,
it also shows a real excitement about the most earnest mental problems,
of which English papers are innocent, or rather incapable.
The Sun was full of the most solemn matters treated in the most
farcical way.  William James figured there as well as "Weary Willie,"
and pragmatists alternated with pugilists in the long procession
of its portraits.

     Thus, when a very unobtrusive Oxford man named John Boulnois
wrote in a very unreadable review called the Natural Philosophy Quarterly
a series of articles on alleged weak points in Darwinian evolution,
it fluttered no corner of the English papers; though Boulnois's theory
(which was that of a comparatively stationary universe visited occasionally
by convulsions of change) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford,
and got so far as to be named "Catastrophism".  But many American papers
seized on the challenge as a great event; and the Sun threw
the shadow of Mr Boulnois quite gigantically across its pages.
By the paradox already noted, articles of valuable intelligence and
enthusiasm were presented with headlines apparently written
by an illiterate maniac, headlines such as "Darwin Chews Dirt;
Critic Boulnois says He Jumps the Shocks"--or "Keep Catastrophic,
says Thinker Boulnois." And Mr Calhoun Kidd, of the Western Sun,
was bidden to take his butterfly tie and lugubrious visage down to
the little house outside Oxford where Thinker Boulnois lived
in happy ignorance of such a title.

     That fated philosopher had consented, in a somewhat dazed manner,
to receive the interviewer, and had named the hour of nine that evening.
The last of a summer sunset clung about Cumnor and the low wooded hills;
the romantic Yankee was both doubtful of his road and inquisitive
about his surroundings; and seeing the door of a genuine feudal
old-country inn, The Champion Arms, standing open, he went in
to make inquiries.

     In the bar parlour he rang the bell, and had to wait
some little time for a reply to it.  The only other person present
was a lean man with close red hair and loose, horsey-looking clothes,
who was drinking very bad whisky, but smoking a very good cigar.
The whisky, of course, was the choice brand of The Champion Arms;
the cigar he had probably brought with him from London.
Nothing could be more different than his cynical negligence from
the dapper dryness of the young American; but something in his pencil
and open notebook, and perhaps in the expression of his alert blue eye,
caused Kidd to guess, correctly, that he was a brother journalist.

     "Could you do me the favour," asked Kidd, with the courtesy of
his nation, "of directing me to the Grey Cottage, where Mr Boulnois lives,
as I understand?"

     "It's a few yards down the road," said the red-haired man,
removing his cigar; "I shall be passing it myself in a minute,
but I'm going on to Pendragon Park to try and see the fun."

     "What is Pendragon Park?" asked Calhoun Kidd.

     "Sir Claude Champion's place--haven't you come down for that, too?"
asked the other pressman, looking up.  "You're a journalist, aren't you?"

     "I have come to see Mr Boulnois," said Kidd.

     "I've come to see Mrs Boulnois," replied the other.
"But I shan't catch her at home." And he laughed rather unpleasantly.

     "Are you interested in Catastrophism?" asked the wondering Yankee.

     "I'm interested in catastrophes; and there are going to be some,"
replied his companion gloomily.  "Mine's a filthy trade,
and I never pretend it isn't."

     With that he spat on the floor; yet somehow in the very act and
instant one could realize that the man had been brought up as a gentleman.

     The American pressman considered him with more attention.
His face was pale and dissipated, with the promise of formidable passions
yet to be loosed; but it was a clever and sensitive face; his clothes
were coarse and careless, but he had a good seal ring on one of his long,
thin fingers.  His name, which came out in the course of talk,
was James Dalroy; he was the son of a bankrupt Irish landlord,
and attached to a pink paper which he heartily despised, called
Smart Society, in the capacity of reporter and of something
painfully like a spy.

     Smart Society, I regret to say, felt none of that interest in
Boulnois on Darwin which was such a credit to the head and hearts of
the Western Sun.  Dalroy had come down, it seemed, to snuff up
the scent of a scandal which might very well end in the Divorce Court,
but which was at present hovering between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Park.

     Sir Claude Champion was known to the readers of the Western Sun
as well as Mr Boulnois.  So were the Pope and the Derby Winner;
but the idea of their intimate acquaintanceship would have struck Kidd
as equally incongruous.  He had heard of (and written about,
nay, falsely pretended to know) Sir Claude Champion, as
"one of the brightest and wealthiest of England's Upper Ten";
as the great sportsman who raced yachts round the world;
as the great traveller who wrote books about the Himalayas,
as the politician who swept constituencies with a startling sort of
Tory Democracy, and as the great dabbler in art, music, literature,
and, above all, acting.  Sir Claude was really rather magnificent in
other than American eyes.  There was something of the Renascence Prince
about his omnivorous culture and restless publicity--, he was not only
a great amateur, but an ardent one.  There was in him none of that
antiquarian frivolity that we convey by the word "dilettante".

     That faultless falcon profile with purple-black Italian eye,
which had been snap-shotted so often both for Smart Society and
the Western Sun, gave everyone the impression of a man eaten by ambition
as by a fire, or even a disease.  But though Kidd knew a great deal
about Sir Claude--a great deal more, in fact, than there was to know--
it would never have crossed his wildest dreams to connect so showy
an aristocrat with the newly-unearthed founder of Catastrophism,
or to guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be
intimate friends.  Such, according to Dalroy's account,
was nevertheless the fact.  The two had hunted in couples at school
and college, and, though their social destinies had been very different
(for Champion was a great landlord and almost a millionaire,
while Boulnois was a poor scholar and, until just lately,
an unknown one), they still kept in very close touch with each other.
Indeed, Boulnois's cottage stood just outside the gates of Pendragon Park.

     But whether the two men could be friends much longer was becoming
a dark and ugly question.  A year or two before, Boulnois had married
a beautiful and not unsuccessful actress, to whom he was devoted
in his own shy and ponderous style; and the proximity of the household
to Champion's had given that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving
in a way that could not but cause painful and rather base excitement.
Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection;
and he seemed to take a crazy pleasure in being equally ostentatious
in an intrigue that could do him no sort of honour.  Footmen from
Pendragon were perpetually leaving bouquets for Mrs Boulnois;
carriages and motor-cars were perpetually calling at the cottage
for Mrs Boulnois; balls and masquerades perpetually filled the grounds
in which the baronet paraded Mrs Boulnois, like the Queen of
Love and Beauty at a tournament.  That very evening, marked by Mr
Kidd for the exposition of Catastrophism, had been marked by
Sir Claude Champion for an open-air rendering of Romeo and Juliet,
in which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet it was needless to name.

     "I don't think it can go on without a smash," said the young man
with red hair, getting up and shaking himself.  "Old Boulnois may be
squared--or he may be square.  But if he's square he's thick--
what you might call cubic.  But I don't believe it's possible."

     "He is a man of grand intellectual powers," said Calhoun Kidd
in a deep voice.

     "Yes," answered Dalroy; "but even a man of grand intellectual powers
can't be such a blighted fool as all that.  Must you be going on?
I shall be following myself in a minute or two."

     But Calhoun Kidd, having finished a milk and soda, betook himself
smartly up the road towards the Grey Cottage, leaving his cynical informant
to his whisky and tobacco.  The last of the daylight had faded;
the skies were of a dark, green-grey, like slate, studded here and there
with a star, but lighter on the left side of the sky, with the promise
of a rising moon.

     The Grey Cottage, which stood entrenched, as it were, in a square
of stiff, high thorn-hedges, was so close under the pines and palisades
of the Park that Kidd at first mistook it for the Park Lodge.
Finding the name on the narrow wooden gate, however, and seeing
by his watch that the hour of the "Thinker's" appointment had just struck,
he went in and knocked at the front door.  Inside the garden hedge,
he could see that the house, though unpretentious enough, was larger
and more luxurious than it looked at first, and was quite a different kind
of place from a porter's lodge.  A dog-kennel and a beehive stood outside,
like symbols of old English country-life; the moon was rising behind
a plantation of prosperous pear trees, the dog that came out of the kennel
was reverend-looking and reluctant to bark; and the plain, elderly
man-servant who opened the door was brief but dignified.

     "Mr Boulnois asked me to offer his apologies, sir," he said,
"but he has been obliged to go out suddenly."

     "But see here, I had an appointment," said the interviewer,
with a rising voice.  "Do you know where he went to?"

     "To Pendragon Park, sir," said the servant, rather sombrely,
and began to close the door.

     Kidd started a little.

     "Did he go with Mrs--with the rest of the party?" he asked
rather vaguely.

     "No, sir," said the man shortly; "he stayed behind, and then
went out alone." And he shut the door, brutally, but with an air of
duty not done.

     The American, that curious compound of impudence and sensitiveness,
was annoyed.  He felt a strong desire to hustle them all along a bit
and teach them business habits; the hoary old dog and the grizzled,
heavy-faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt-front, and the drowsy
old moon, and above all the scatter-brained old philosopher who
couldn't keep an appointment.

     "If that's the way he goes on he deserves to lose his wife's
purest devotion," said Mr Calhoun Kidd.  "But perhaps he's gone over
to make a row.  In that case I reckon a man from the Western Sun
will be on the spot."

     And turning the corner by the open lodge-gates, he set off,
stumping up the long avenue of black pine-woods that pointed
in abrupt perspective towards the inner gardens of Pendragon Park.
The trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse;
there were still a few stars.  He was a man with more literary
than direct natural associations; the word "Ravenswood" came into
his head repeatedly.  It was partly the raven colour of the pine-woods;
but partly also an indescribable atmosphere almost described
in Scott's great tragedy; the smell of something that died
in the eighteenth century; the smell of dank gardens and broken urns,
of wrongs that will never now be righted; of something that is
none the less incurably sad because it is strangely unreal.

     More than once, as he went up that strange, black road
of tragic artifice, he stopped, startled, thinking he heard steps
in front of him.  He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre
walls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them.  At first
he thought he must have fancied it or been mocked by a mere echo of
his own tramp.  But as he went on he was more and more inclined
to conclude, with the remains of his reason, that there really were
other feet upon the road.  He thought hazily of ghosts; and was surprised
how swiftly he could see the image of an appropriate and local ghost,
one with a face as white as Pierrot's, but patched with black.
The apex of the triangle of dark-blue sky was growing brighter and bluer,
but he did not realize as yet that this was because he was coming
nearer to the lights of the great house and garden.  He only felt
that the atmosphere was growing more intense, there was in the sadness
more violence and secrecy--more--he hesitated for the word,
and then said it with a jerk of laughter--Catastrophism.

     More pines, more pathway slid past him, and then he stood rooted
as by a blast of magic.  It is vain to say that he felt as if he had
got into a dream; but this time he felt quite certain that he had
got into a book.  For we human beings are used to inappropriate things;
we are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous; it is a tune
to which we can go to sleep.  If one appropriate thing happens,
it wakes us up like the pang of a perfect chord.  Something happened
such as would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale.

     Over the black pine-wood came flying and flashing in the moon
a naked sword--such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have
fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park.  It fell on the pathway
far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle.
He ran like a hare and bent to look at it.  Seen at close quarters
it had rather a showy look:  the big red jewels in the hilt and guard
were a little dubious.  But there were other red drops upon the blade
which were not dubious.

     He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile
had come, and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine
was interrupted by a smaller road at right angles; which, when he turned it,
brought him in full view of the long, lighted house, with a lake and
fountains in front of it.  Nevertheless, he did not look at this,
having something more interesting to look at.

     Above him, at the angle of the steep green bank of the
terraced garden, was one of those small picturesque surprises
common in the old landscape gardening; a kind of small round hill or
dome of grass, like a giant mole-hill, ringed and crowned with
three concentric fences of roses, and having a sundial in the highest point
in the centre.  Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark
against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight
clinging to that idle clock.  But he saw something else clinging
to it also, for one wild moment--the figure of a man.

     Though he saw it there only for a moment, though it was outlandish
and incredible in costume, being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson,
with glints of gold, yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was.
That white face flung up to heaven, clean-shaven and so unnaturally young,
like Byron with a Roman nose, those black curls already grizzled--
he had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude Champion.
The wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial; the next
it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American's feet,
faintly moving one arm.  A gaudy, unnatural gold ornament on the arm
suddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo and Juliet; of course the tight crimson
suit was part of the play.  But there was a long red stain down
the bank from which the man had rolled--that was no part of the play.
He had been run through the body.

     Mr Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again.  Once more he seemed
to hear phantasmal footsteps, and started to find another figure
already near him.  He knew the figure, and yet it terrified him.
The dissipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet
way with him; if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made,
Dalroy had a sinister air of keeping appointments that hadn't.
The moonlight discoloured everything, against Dalroy's red hair
his wan face looked not so much white as pale green.

     All this morbid impressionism must be Kidd's excuse for having
cried out, brutally and beyond all reason:  "Did you do this, you devil?"

     James Dalroy smiled his unpleasing smile; but before he could speak,
the fallen figure made another movement of the arm, waving vaguely
towards the place where the sword fell; then came a moan, and then
it managed to speak.

     "Boulnois....  Boulnois, I say....  Boulnois did it...
jealous of me...he was jealous, he was, he was..."

     Kidd bent his head down to hear more, and just managed
to catch the words:

     "Boulnois...with my own sword...he threw it..."

     Again the failing hand waved towards the sword, and then fell rigid
with a thud.  In Kidd rose from its depth all that acrid humour
that is the strange salt of the seriousness of his race.

     "See here," he said sharply and with command, "you must
fetch a doctor.  This man's dead."

     "And a priest, too, I suppose," said Dalroy in an undecipherable manner.
"All these Champions are papists."

     The American knelt down by the body, felt the heart, propped up
the head and used some last efforts at restoration; but before
the other journalist reappeared, followed by a doctor and a priest,
he was already prepared to assert they were too late.

     "Were you too late also?" asked the doctor, a solid
prosperous-looking man, with conventional moustache and whiskers,
but a lively eye, which darted over Kidd dubiously.

     "In one sense," drawled the representative of the Sun.
"I was too late to save the man, but I guess I was in time to hear
something of importance.  I heard the dead man denounce his assassin."

     "And who was the assassin?" asked the doctor, drawing his
eyebrows together.

     "Boulnois," said Calhoun Kidd, and whistled softly.

     The doctor stared at him gloomily with a reddening brow--,
but he did not contradict.  Then the priest, a shorter figure
in the background, said mildly:  "I understood that Mr Boulnois
was not coming to Pendragon Park this evening."

     "There again," said the Yankee grimly, "I may be in a position
to give the old country a fact or two.  Yes, sir, John Boulnois
was going to stay in all this evening; he fixed up a real good appointment
there with me.  But John Boulnois changed his mind; John Boulnois
left his home abruptly and all alone, and came over to this darned Park
an hour or so ago.  His butler told me so.  I think we hold what
the all-wise police call a clue--have you sent for them?"

     "Yes," said the doctor, "but we haven't alarmed anyone else yet."

     "Does Mrs Boulnois know?" asked James Dalroy, and again Kidd
was conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curling mouth.

     "I have not told her," said the doctor gruffly--, "but here come
the police."

     The little priest had stepped out into the main avenue,
and now returned with the fallen sword, which looked ludicrously large
and theatrical when attached to his dumpy figure, at once clerical
and commonplace.  "Just before the police come," he said apologetically,
"has anyone got a light?"

     The Yankee journalist took an electric torch from his pocket,
and the priest held it close to the middle part of the blade,
which he examined with blinking care.  Then, without glancing at
the point or pommel, he handed the long weapon to the doctor.

     "I fear I'm no use here," he said, with a brief sigh.
"I'll say good night to you, gentlemen." And he walked away
up the dark avenue towards the house, his hands clasped behind him
and his big head bent in cogitation.

     The rest of the group made increased haste towards the lodge-gates,
where an inspector and two constables could already be seen
in consultation with the lodge-keeper.  But the little priest
only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine, and at last
stopped dead, on the steps of the house.  It was his silent way
of acknowledging an equally silent approach; for there came towards
him a presence that might have satisfied even Calhoun Kidd's demands
for a lovely and aristocratic ghost.  It was a young woman
in silvery satins of a Renascence design; she had golden hair
in two long shining ropes, and a face so startingly pale between them
that she might have been chryselephantine--made, that is, like some
old Greek statues, out of ivory and gold.  But her eyes were very bright,
and her voice, though low, was confident.

     "Father Brown?" she said.

     "Mrs Boulnois?" he replied gravely.  Then he looked at her and
immediately said:  "I see you know about Sir Claude."

     "How do you know I know?" she asked steadily.

     He did not answer the question, but asked another:  "Have you
seen your husband?"

     "My husband is at home," she said.  "He has nothing to do with this."

     Again he did not answer; and the woman drew nearer to him,
with a curiously intense expression on her face.

     "Shall I tell you something more?" she said, with a rather
fearful smile.  "I don't think he did it, and you don't either."
Father Brown returned her gaze with a long, grave stare, and then nodded,
yet more gravely.

     "Father Brown," said the lady, "I am going to tell you all I know,
but I want you to do me a favour first.  Will you tell me why
you haven't jumped to the conclusion of poor John's guilt,
as all the rest have done?   Don't mind what you say:  I--I know about
the gossip and the appearances that are against me."

     Father Brown looked honestly embarrassed, and passed his hand
across his forehead.  "Two very little things," he said.
"At least, one's very trivial and the other very vague.
But such as they are, they don't fit in with Mr Boulnois
being the murderer."

     He turned his blank, round face up to the stars and
