Islam "conquer" Europe, what drivel. I'd be surprised if any European country had 5%+ of its population declared as Muslim.
 
EDIT: not surprised I'm getting downvoted by the "leftist"-but-bigot Reddit community, but this is as much of a ghost hunt as MacArthur's systemic persecution of communists was in Cold War USA. [Less than 4% of the EU is Muslim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Europe), with a good part of the countries from which these signers are from having less than 1% of its population Muslim.

EDIT 2: a good gauge of the mentality of the people you're discussing with is that they saw fit to open my profile and downvote every comment I made in the past few days. Woe be my internet points, so dearly missed.
