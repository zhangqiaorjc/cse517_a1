How people misinterpret this as, all things considered, some sort of ethical failure is beyond me. 

People who say Iraq 2 was a genocide, will in the same breath, condemn the peaceful collaboration between US and Saudi Arabia. It's absolutely mind-boggling. 

There is only war and peace...They're monsters and we need to influence the downfall of Islamism everywhere, but we absolutely need to stay in good standing with influential nations around the world, and not engage them unless it's incredibly justified to do so in creating a safer, better world for everyone.
