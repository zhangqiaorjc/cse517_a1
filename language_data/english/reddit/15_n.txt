Christianity had a stranglehold on Europe for centuries. The people shrugged it off and now live in a secular world. The notion of a few immigrants plunging Europe back into theocracy is beyond ridiculous. Especially since most of those immigrants are looking for freedom from the oppression they left behind.

I understand that's not what a few opportunist politicians are willing to admit. But it's the truth.
